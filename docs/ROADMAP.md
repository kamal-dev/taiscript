# üéØ **ROADMAP**
### **TaiScript Development Roadmap**  
_"The only language that taxes your code and needs bribe to compile"_  

---

## **Phase 1: The Foundation (Completed)**  
_"Every empire starts with a bribe."_  

- **Lexer:** Extract tokens like a corrupt politician or the so called govt officers, who collects under-the-table cash.
- **Parser:** Build ASTs like constructing shady infrastructure projects with inflated budgets.
- **Interpreter:** Execute statements like enforcing taxes‚Äîefficient but controversial.

### Features Deployed:  
- **likho:** Declare variables like allocating public funds.
- **ghoshna:** Print statements like bold political speeches‚Äîmost of them useless.
- **agar...warna:** Conditional logic‚Äîdecide if the funds go to "public welfare" or "Swiss accounts."
- **ginti karo:** Loop through shady deals endlessly.
- **file kholo/band karo:** Manipulate files like altering government records.

---

## **Phase 2: Beautification and Tax Evasion Prevention (In Progress)**  
_"Every government needs to hide their past and make sure no one evades the tax"_

- **Single Line & Multi Line Comments:** Support for comments in the code using - // and /* */
- **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of syntax and runtime issues
- **Debugging:** Explain TaiScript decisions step-by-step
- **AST as JSON:** Add feature to print AST in JSON format.

### Planned Features:  
- Comprehensive error messages for runtime crimes.
- Debug mode to trace back shady operations.
- Single line and multi line comments.

---

## **Phase 3: Infrastructure Overhaul (Coming Soon)**
_"Build robust libraries... but take 10 years like a delayed metro project."_

- **String Manipulation:** Handle protests (a.k.a. text) in uppercase or lowercase.
- **File Reading:** Audit previous scams by reading files.
- **Arrays and Dictionaries:** Store black money in structured formats.

---

## **Phase 4: Advanced Corruption Techniques (Planned)**
_"Add hierarchy, inheritance, coverups and more."_

- **OOP Support:** Create classes for ministers and instantiate objects for every constituency.
- **Functions:** Reuse bribery logic like awarding government contracts to cronies. (karam karo)

---

## **Phase 5: Optimization Scams (Planned)**  
_"It's election time, show that you are working more: Enhance the performance."_

- **Performance Boost:** Make loops run as fast as a tax haven transaction.
- **Variable Lookup Optimization:** Make fund transfers quicker than bank inspections.

---

## **Phase 6: International Scandals (Planned)**  
_"Globalize TaiScript and connect with offshore languages."_

- **Python Embedding:** Enable inter-language bribery collaborations.
- **Compiled TaiScript:** Convert to C for faster offshore laundering.

---

## **Phase 7: Anti-Corruption Testing (Planned)**
_"Every scam needs a cover-up... or thorough testing."_

- **Unit Testing:** Ensure the lexer, parser, and interpreter all pass bribe audits.
- **Integration Testing:** Simulate full-scale corruption using test cases.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automate testing like a well-oiled public procurement scam.

---

## **Phase 8: Propaganda & Public Image (Planned)**
_"Spread the gospel of TaiScript."_

- **Documentation:** Provide a better README and keyword docs like political manifestos.
- **Examples:** Showcase code snippets that even the public can‚Äôt object to.

---

## **Current Status**  
- **Foundation of Corruption (Phase 1):** Complete ‚úÖ  
- **Tax Evasion Prevention (Phase 2):** In Progress üîÑ  
- **Future Scandals (Phase 3‚Äì8):** In Planning üìù
