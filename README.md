# **🪙 TaiScript - The only language that taxes your code and needs bribe to compile**

### **Bringing the chaos of Governance into programming.**

TaiScript is a satirical, programming language insiperd by day-to-day life of a citizen of a country that mirrors real-life inefficiencies, taxation burdens, corruptions and bribery. From mandatory bribes for program execution to random power cuts halting loops, TaiScript offers an unparalleled programming experience rooted in dark humor.

---

### **🚀 Features**
- **Mandatory Bribes**: Execute code only after `ghoos lo`. No bribes, no progress! (Well exceptions are always there :))
- **Infrastructure Failures**: Use `bijli chali gayi` to break loops (power cuts in action!).
- **Structured Programming**: Define and use structures with `dhacha bano`.
- **Privilege System (`parichay`)**: Your role affects how much bribe is required:
  - `Janta`: Maximum bribes, there is some delay in viewing the output of the compilation.
  - `Student`: 50% discount on bribes, there is some delay in viewing the output of the compilation..
  - `Chacha Vidhayak Hai`: No bribe needed, instant compilation
  - `Babu Saheb`: No bribe needed, but equivalent black money will be credited.
  - `Neta Ji`: 	No bribe needed, but output is printed only after Neta Ji's praise - "Ye sab Neta Ji ke ashirwad se hua hai!"
- **Human-Readable Syntax**: Declare variables with `likho`, output results with `ghoshna`, and more. Like natural language—write programs that even babus understand!

### **📜 Example Code**
```plaintext
yojna shuru "TaxCompute"

parichay Janta   # Ordinary citizen, heavy bribes required

ghoos lo 1000    # Basic chai-paani for program execution

# Variable Declaration
likho salary 500000
likho tax_rate 30

# Tax Calculation
ghoos lo 3000    # Bribe required for tax calculation
likho tax salary me guna karo (tax_rate ka bhag karo 100)
likho net_salary salary se ghatao tax

# Output
ghoos lo 500     # Printing requires chai-paani
ghoshna "Final salary after tax is: " me jodo net_salary

yojna band
